  Abstract                 = {The dual basic tasks of evaluating ship waves at the free surface and of removing unwanted short waves are considered within the framework of the free-surface Green function potential flow theory, based on a Green function that satisfies the radiation condition and the Kelvin-Michell linearized boundary condition at the free surface. A practical approach based on parabolic extrapolation within an extrapolation layer bordering the free surface is used. The height of the extrapolation layer is defined explicitly via simple analytical relations in terms of the Froude number and the slenderness of the ship hull, and varies from the bow to the stern. The bow-to-stern variation is an important ingredient that accounts for the fact that waves along the ship hull aft of the bow wave differ from the bow wave. Indeed, a ship bow wave is significantly higher and shorter than waves aft of the bow wave, is affected by nearfield effects related to the rapid variation of the hull geometry at a ship bow, and consequently contains more short wave components. Illustrative calculations demonstrate the need for removing short ship waves and the effectiveness of the approach based on parabolic extrapolation.},

We model the disturbance by an elliptical pressure field of given aspect ratio W. We study the wake pattern as a function of W and the longitudinal hull Froude number Fr = V/root gL, where V is the velocity, g is the acceleration of gravity, and L is the size of the disturbance in the direction of motion. For large hull Froude numbers, we analytically show that the rescaled surface profiles for which root W/Fr is kept constant coincide. In particular, the angle outside which the surface is essentially flat remains constant and equal to the Kelvin angle, and the angle corresponding to the maximum amplitude of the waves scales as root W/Fr, thus showing that previous work on the wake's angle for isotropic objects can be extended to anisotropic objects of given aspect ratio. We then focus on the wave resistance and discuss its properties in the case of an elliptical Gaussian pressure field. We derive an analytical expression for the wave resistance in the limit of very elongated objects and show that the position of the speed corresponding to the maximum wave resistance scales as root gL/root W.

It was proved by Lord Kelvin that such a wake is delimited by a constant angle similar or equal to 19.47 degrees. However a recent study by Rabaud and Moisy based on the observation of airborne images showed that the wake angle seems to decrease as the Froude number Fr increases, scaling as Fr-1 for large Froude numbers. To explain such observations they make the strong hypothesis that an object of size b cannot generate wavelengths larger than b. Without the need of such an assumption and modelling the moving object by an axisymmetric pressure field, we analytically show that the angle corresponding to the maximum amplitude of the waves scales as Fr-1 for large Froude numbers, whereas the angle delimiting the wake region outside which the surface is essentially flat remains constant and equal to the Kelvin angle for all Fr.},

We solve the linear ship wave problem in the presence of a shear current of constant vorticity S, and show that the Kelvin angles (one each side of wake) as well as other aspects of the wake depend closely on the 'shear Froude number' Fr-s = VS I g (based on length g/S-2 and the ship's speed V), and on the angle between current and the ship's line of motion. In all directions except exactly along the shear flow there exists a critical value of Fr-s beyond which no transverse waves are produced, and where the full wake angle reaches 180 degrees. Such critical behaviour is previously known from waves at finite depth. For side-on shear, one Kelvin angle can exceed 90 degrees. On the other hand, the angle of maximum wave amplitude scales as Fr-1 (Fr based on size of ship) when Fr >> 1, a scaling virtually unaffected by the shear flow.},

It was found that the stationary wave structure behind the ship covered a wedge region with the 16.9 degrees half an angle at the top of the wake and only divergent waves are present in a ship wake for co propagating wind waves. Wind waves field directed at some nonzero angle to the ship motion can cause essential asymmetry of the wake and compressing of its windward half. The extension of Whitham-Lighthill kinematics theory of ship wake for the intermediate sea depth is also presented. The ship wake structure essentially depends from the Froude (Fr) number based on the value of the sea depth and ship velocity. For Froude number less than unit both longitudinal and cross waves are presented in the wake region and Kelvin wake angle increased with Fr. For Fr > 1 wake angle decreased with Froude number and finally only divergent waves are presented in the very narrow ship wake.},

  Abstract                 = {A theoretical explanation of observations of high-Froude-number ship wakes that are narrower than the classical Kelvin 39 angle was recently offered by Rabaud and Moisy. The explanation relies on the assumption that a ship hull does not create waves longer than its length. A validation of this theoretical model has also been given. The validation is based on the approximation of the flow created by a ship hull by means of a Gaussian distribution of pressure at the free surface. These two flow models predict a wake angle 0.,, that decreases like 1/F as the Froude number F increases beyond F 0.5. A third theoretical explanation was recently proposed by the authors. This theoretical explanation assumes that the wave pattern of a ship mostly consists of dominant waves that are created by the ship bow and stern, and is mostly determined by interference effects between these dominant waves. The analysis of interference effects on the Kelvin wake of a ship predicts a wake angle -""- 0.14/F2 for a monohull ship, or Ika, 0.2.VE/F for a catamaran with beam/length ratio b. The 'flow models' underlying these three alternative theoretical explanations of narrow ship wakes are examined, and the corresponding theoretical predictions are compared to the 37 observations of ship wakes reported by Rabaud and Moisy for Froude numbers F within the wide range 0.1 < F < 1.7. The wake observations are found to be consistent with the predictions given by an analysis of interference between the bow and stern waves of a monohull ship, or a catamaran with beam/length ratio b within the range 0.4 < b < 0.8. Indeed, agreement is consistently strong for the 35 wake observations within the range 0.1 < F < 1.4. This range of Froude numbers includes the range F < 0.6, where interference between transverse bow and stern waves is important, and corresponds to the vast majority of ships. The predictions given by the Rabaud Moisy 'cutoff-wavelength model' and the 'Gaussian pressure distribution model' are in close agreement with two wake observations for 1.6 <F < 1.7 and may also be consistent with several wake observations for 0.6 < F < 1.4, but are not consistent with most observations. This finding and a critical examination of the assumptions underlying the Rabaud Moisy model and the Gaussian pressure distribution model suggest that these theoretical models may not be realistic for most ships. This conclusion is further validated by numerical computations of wave patterns for F = 1. The computed waves are largest along a ray angle that agrees with the prediction of the bow and stern waves interference model, but is noticeably smaller than predicted by the Gaussian pressure distribution model.

The cylindrical surface aft of the forebody has nearly rectangular framelines, with beam 2b and draft d: The forebody is determined by its length 鈩? and seven other parameters that further control its shape. These eight shape parameters, plus the beam and the draft, define a relatively general and realistic mathematical family of ship hulls that can be used for optimization and related basic studies. The calm-water drag of this family of ship hulls is estimated as the sum of the friction drag and the wave drag given by the classical ITTC friction formula and the Hogner slender-ship approximation. This approach provides a particularly simple and efficient way of estimating the total drag that can be used to gain insight for concept and preliminary design. The variations of the displacement volume, the friction and wave components of the drag, and the total drag of the hull that result from variations of the parameters associated with the mathematical family of ship hulls are considered.},

The two-fluid system which consists of an upper inviscid and a lower viscous fluid is assumed to be incompressible, homogenous and stable. The interfacial elevation is given by a double Fourier integral, which involves a generic amplitude function, a complex dispersion function and an elementary phase function. With the aid of four kinds of expansion of the phase function, the asymptotic representations of the far-field wave profiles are explicitly derived for four regions as the azimuth angle is less than, less than but close to, at, and greater than but close to, the maximal angle of the V-wedge for Kelvin ship waves. Graphical representations of wave. profiles show the consistency of four asymptotic schemes. A combination of the Stokes and Scorer methods of stationary phase gives uniformly valid results over the panoramic region. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In all cases the wake angle is found to follow a Mach-like law at large velocity, alpha approximately U(-1), but with different prefactors depending on the value of Bo(D). For small Bo(D) (large capillary effects), the wake angle approximately follows the law alpha approximately c(g,min)/U, where c(g,min) is the minimum group velocity of capillary-gravity waves. For larger Bo(D) (weak capillary effects), we recover a law alpha approximately radical[gD]/U similar to that found for ship wakes at large velocity [Rabaud and Moisy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 214503 (2013)]. Using the general property of dispersive waves that the characteristic wavelength of the wave packet emitted by a disturbance is of order of the disturbance size, we propose a simple model that describes the transition between these two Mach-like regimes as the Bond number is varied. We show that the new capillary law alpha approximately c(g,min)/U originates from the presence of a capillary cusp angle (distinct from the usual gravity cusp angle), along which the energy radiated by the disturbance accumulates for Bond numbers of order of unity. This model, complemented by numerical simulations of the surface elevation induced by a moving Gaussian pressure disturbance, is in qualitative agreement with experimental measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been recently emphasized that the angle of maximum wave amplitude alpha in the wake of a disturbance of finite size can be significantly narrower than the maximum value alpha_{K}=sin^{-1}(1/3) approximately 19.47^{ composite function} predicted by the classical analysis of Kelvin. For axisymmetric disturbance, a simple argument based on the Cauchy-Poisson initial-value problem suggests that the wake angle decreases following a Mach-like law at large velocity, alpha approximately Fr_{L}^{-1}, where Fr_{L}=U/sqrt[gL] is the Froude number based on the disturbance velocity U, its size L, and gravity g. In this paper we extend this analysis to the case of nonaxisymmetric disturbances, relevant to real ships. We find that, for intermediate Froude numbers, the wake angle follows an intermediate scaling law alpha approximately Fr_{L}^{-2}, in agreement with the recent prediction of Noblesse et al. [Eur. J. Mech. B/Fluids 46, 164 (2014)]. We show that beyond a critical Froude number, which scales as A^{1/2} (where A is the length-to-width aspect ratio of the disturbance), the asymptotic scaling alpha approximately Fr_{B}^{-1} holds, where now Fr_{B}=A^{1/2}Fr_{L} is the Froude number based on the disturbance width. We propose a simple model for this transition, and provide a regime diagram of the scaling of the wake angle as a function of parameters (A,Fr_{L}).},

  Abstract                 = {While the half-angle which encloses a Kelvin ship wave pattern is commonly accepted to be 19.47 degrees, recent observations and calculations for sufficiently fast-moving ships suggest that the apparent wake angle decreases with ship speed. One explanation for this decrease in angle relies on the assumption that a ship cannot generate wavelengths much greater than its hull length. An alternative interpretation is that the wave pattern that is observed in practice is defined by the location of the highest peaks; for wakes created by sufficiently fast-moving objects, these highest peaks no longer lie on the outermost divergent waves, resulting in a smaller apparent angle. In this paper, we focus on the problems of free-surface flow past a single submerged point source and past a submerged source doublet. In the linear version of these problems, we measure the apparent wake angle formed by the highest peaks, and observe the following three regimes: a small Froude number pattern, in which the divergent waves are not visible; standard wave patterns for which the maximum peaks occur on the outermost divergent waves; and a third regime in which the highest peaks form a V-shape with an angle much less than the Kelvin angle. For nonlinear flows, we demonstrate that nonlinearity has the effect of increasing the apparent wake angle so that some highly nonlinear solutions have apparent wake angles that are greater than Kelvin's angle. For large Froude numbers, the effect on apparent wake angle can be more dramatic, with the possibility of strong nonlinearity shifting the wave pattern from the third regime to the second. We expect that our nonlinear results will translate to other more complicated flow configurations, such as flow due to a steadily moving closed body such as a submarine.},

For the problem of flow past an axisymmetric pressure distribution in a finite-depth channel, we report on the apparent angle of the wake, which is the angle of maximum peaks. For moderately deep channels, the dependence of the apparent wake angle on the Froude number is very different to the wedge angle and varies smoothly as FH passes through the critical value FH = 1. For shallow water, the two angles tend to follow each other more closely, which leads to very large apparent wake angles for certain regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {More than 3000 commercial vessels navigate through the Malamocco-Marghera Industrial Canal in Venice Lagoon, Italy in a given year, leading to an estimated annual resuspension of 1.2 x 10(6) metric tons of sediment. Hence, ship wakes contribute to the significant erosion of shoals in the central lagoon which has occurred over the last 30 years. Drawdown associated with the surface depression wave from successive ships induces sediment transport towards the shipping canal, where the cost of dredging amounts to tens of millions of Euro per year. Most ship traffic occurs near an industrial zone, resulting in substantial potential for resuspension of contaminated sediment. Thus, sediment resuspension by ship traffic in the Venice Lagoon has the potential for detrimental economic and environmental impacts. This paper illustrates the impacts of ship induced depression waves and discusses management options for mitigating those impacts, based on extensive observational data and analysis conducted in Venice Lagoon, Italy. This article helps to further the understanding of the processes that govern sediment transport along the shipping channel and employ this knowledge to develop specific management recommendations. A reduction in the navigation speed of ships, an increase in the distance between successive ships, and limiting navigation to tidal levels above 0.3 m from the local 1897 reference mean sea level can help to minimize these problems.

  Abstract                 = {This short contribution reports the results of a field study on the nearshore characteristics of waves generated by both conventional and high speed passenger ferries. The field observations took place in the late summer of 2005, at a beach close to the port of Mytilene (Island of Lesbos, Greece), and involved the visual observation of ship waves, using digital video recordings and image processing techniques. The results showed that passage of the fast ferry was associated with a longer, more complex and energetic nearshore event; this event not only did include higher nearshore waves (up to 0.74 m) and was organised in different wave packets, but it was also an order of magnitude longer (similar to 680 s) than the conventional ferry event. Regarding the effects on beach sediment dynamics, the fast ferry waves were estimated to be very efficient in mobilising the nearshore sediments in contrast to those of the conventional ferry. The fast ferry service appears to generate daily prolonged nearshore events, which contain waves with higher energy than those expected from the normal summer wind wave regime of the area; these events also include some high and very steep waves, which can be particularly erosive. Therefore, fast ferry wakes may have considerable impacts on the seasonal beach sediment dynamics/morphodynamics and the nearshore benthic ecology, as well as they may pose significant risks to bathers, affecting the recreational use of the beaches exposed to fast ferry traffic.

Water is endowed with viscosity, and anybody moving through a viscous fluid, experiences a resistance, partly because of tangentially acting stresses on the body, but partly also because boundary-layer growth, and separation, if it occurs, yield a resistance resulting from integrating normal components of the stress over the body. The frictional resistance will certainly depend upon the wave profile along the ship. On the other hand, the wave pattern itself is going to depend in some fashion upon the ship's boundary layer and wake. The effects of gravity and viscosity interact in essential ways. There seems to be no neat practicable definition of gravitational or wave resistance without introducing assumptions or approximations.},

  Abstract                 = {Wave-interference effects on the wave pattern of a monohull ship that advances at constant speed along a straight path in calm water are considered. The flow around the ship is represented via a continuous distribution of sources over the hull surface, rather than via a point source at the bow and a point sink at the stern. A practical and realistic numerical method for determining the apparent wake angle psi(max), where the largest waves are found at high Froude numbers, for general ship hulls (including multihulls and/or distributions of pressure at the free surface) is considered. The method only involves elementary numerical computations that can be performed simply and efficiently. The method is therefore used here to perform systematic computations for seven ship hulls that correspond to broad ranges of main hull-shape parameters (beam/length, draft/length, beam/draft, waterline entrance angle) at ten Froude numbers. This numerical study shows that the apparent wake angle psi(max) is only weakly influenced by the shape of the ship hull. A useful practical consequence of this numerical finding is that the wake angle psi(max) can be estimated for general monohull ships via simple analytical relations. These relations provide relatively-accurate practical estimates (without computations) of the apparent wake angle psi(max)(F) for arbitrary ship hull forms and Froude numbers. The explicit approximations for the wake angle psi(max)(F) obtained here account for both longitudinal interference between the divergent waves created by the fore and aft regions of a monohull ship and lateral interference between the divergent waves created by the port and starboard sides of the hull. As expected, these relations yield an estimate of the wake angle psi(max)(F) for a monohull ship that is more precise than the analytical estimate given by an elementary analysis of interference between the dominant waves created by the bow and the stern of a ship, which corresponds to a 2-point wavemaker approximation of the continuous hull-surface distribution of sources considered here.

Unlike alternative numerical methods or the classical stationary-phase analytical approximation that can only be used in restricted regions of the free surface, the method can be applied to compute far-field or near-field waves at arbitrary points of the free surface outside a ship hull. Tests show that a practical number of integration points yield accurate numerical computations in the near field as well as the far field. For validation of the Neumann-Michell theory of ship waves, the method is used to compute the free-surface elevation along longitudinal cuts, for three hull forms at several Froude numbers, and the numerical predictions are compared with experimental measurements.

  Abstract                 = {We consider the nonlinear interactions between the steady Kelvin waves behind an advancing ship and an (unsteady) ambient wave. It is shown that, for moderately steep ship waves and/or ambient waves, third-order (quartet) resonant interaction among the two wave systems could occur, leading to the generation of a new propagating wave along a specific ray in the Kelvin wake. The wave vector of the generated wave as well as the angle of the resonance ray are determined by the resonance condition and are functions of the ship forward speed and the wave vector of the ambient wave. To understand the resonance mechanism and the characteristics of the generated wave, we perform theoretical analyses of this problem using two related approaches. To obtain a relatively simple model in the form of a nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation for the evolution of the resonant wave, we first consider a multiple-scale approach assuming locally discrete Kelvin wave components, with constant wave vectors but varying amplitudes along the resonance ray. This NLS model captures the key resonance mechanism but does not account for the detuning effect associated with the wave vector variation of Kevin waves in the neighbourhood of the resonance ray. To obtain the full quantitative features and evolution characteristics, we also consider a more complete model based on Zakharov's integral equation applied in the context of a continuous wave vector spectrum. The resulting evolution equation can be reduced to an NLS form with, however, cross-ray variable coefficients, on imposing a narrow-band assumption valid in the neighbourhood of the resonance ray. As expected, the two models compare well when wave vector detuning is small, in the near wake close to the ray. To verify the analyses, direct high-resolution simulations of the nonlinear wave interaction problem are obtained using a high-order spectral method. The simulations capture the salient features of the resonance in the near wake of the ship, with good agreements with theory for the location of the resonance and the growth rate of the generated wave.},

The largest waves due to constructive interference result in an apparent wake angle psi(max), that can differ greatly from the cusp or asymptote angles associated with the wave pattern of a ship when interference effects are ignored, as in Kelvin's classical analysis. Thus, wave interference has a very large effect on the wave signature of a ship in shallow water and cannot be ignored. Water-depth effects on the wake angle psi(max) are found to be insignificant for water depths d(L) equivalent to D/L greater than d(deep)(L) approximate to 0.89 or for Froude numbers F equivalent to V/root gL greater than F-deep approximate to 0.5/root d(L). Furthermore, the water depth d(L) has only a relatively small influence on the wake angle psi(max) for 1.5 < F, and the deep-water approximation psi(max) approximate to 0.14/F-2 can then be used.
